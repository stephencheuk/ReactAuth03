        "description": "React is a JavaScript library developed for one main reason¡Xto build reusable UI components that present ever-changing data. The React philosophy is to focus solely on the user interface. In model-view-controller (MVC) terminology, React is the view. Because it has to work with models and other libraries, it's designed to play nicely with pretty much any other framework, router, style, and model library. And it's well-supported¡XReact emerged from Instagram and is now used by Facebook, Asana, Khan Academy, and Atom among many more. React Quickly is for anyone who wants to learn React.js fast. This hands-on book teaches needed concepts by using lots of examples, tutorials, and a large main project that gets built throughout. It starts with the basics, including how React fits into applications, JSX, and handling states, and events. Next, it explores core topics like components, forms, and data. Finally, the book dives into React integration topics, like unit testing and isomorphic JavaScript with Express.js, and Gulp. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",

        "description": "Use React and React Native to build applications for desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and even as native mobile apps About This Book Build React and React Native applications using familiar component concepts Dive deep into each platform, from routing in React to creating native mobile applications that can run offline Use Facebook's Relay, React and GraphQL technologies, to create a unified architecture that powers both web and native applications Who This Book Is For This book is written for any JavaScript developer¡Xbeginner or expert¡Xwho wants to start learning how to put both of Facebook's UI libraries to work. No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Native¡Xthe UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",

        "description": "LAST UPDATE: 09. June 2021 If you are looking for a comprehensive and pragmatic yet concise and up-to-date React.js feat. Hooks book, the Road to React is for you. What you will learn. In \"The Road to React\" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application. Is it up to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step. Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it.

Create beautiful mobile apps with JavaScript and React Deliver high quality mobile apps, at light speed. Building the same app in both Swift and Java is time-consuming. With React Native, you can release a native app on both iOS and Android from a single codebase. Do you or your team already know JavaScript? Leverage your existing knowledge to build world class mobile applications. The React Native ecosystem is evolving fast. Get started on the right foot. With such an active community and so many updates, it feels impossible to know what's best and what's just noise. We cover the latest React Native version and best practices so you can develop with confidence. What You'll Build When you buy Fullstack React Native, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter and provides support for both iOS (including iPhone X screens) & Android. A Weather App - Get your feet wet with React Native by building a weather app allows the user to input their location and grabs weather data from a third party API. A Time Tracker - Brush up on your core React knowledge and build a time tracking app. A Messaging App - Understand how to use the core React Native APIs like Geolocation, CameraRoll, Keyboard, NetInfo and much more through completing a messaging app An Instagram Clone - Learn how to style your app, manage user input, add comments and display photos from Unsplash A Contacts App - Learn how to use Navigation: a major piece of any mobile application with multiple screens A Puzzle Game - Learn how to achieve smooth animations that render at 60 frames-per-second (fps) FAQHow long is the book? The book has 11 chapters totaling 670 pages, several sample apps totaling over 1000+ lines of code (JavaScript/JSX, non-comment lines). Do I have to know React? Nope! We've written the book so that it can be used even if you aren't familiar with React. Although, if you'd like to learn React in depth, checkout our other book Fullstack React Do I have to know JavaScript? Yes, we assume you know the basics of the language. But you don't need to be completely up-to-date: we teach the latest language features in case you're not familiar with them. However, this book teaches React Native from the ground up and you can use it even if you've never written a mobile app before.",
